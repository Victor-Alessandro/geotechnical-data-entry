"""
Originally I did a similar substitution to each docx file so they could be changed with media replacement. The word placeholder images were thus effectively a GUI and whatever changes in format were imposed on them would also be reflected once the template was populated. However, I lost the original and made a mistake on the model (it was a single one as well). There are multiple steps to reproduce previous results: Preparing the template and placeholders, applying the inlining and then performing media replacement during document generation. I do not have the time to identify the bug within these steps and the gain would be minimal.

By the way, the way pasted images are represented on the online and offline versions of word are different. So only the offline one should be used. the online version is a second place citizen.
